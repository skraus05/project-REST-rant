# Project REST-Rant

REST-Rant is an app where users can review restaurants

This project will be done in multiple parts. At the end of part 1, this is what I've accomplished so far:

- [x] setting up the project
- [x] adding express
- [x] adding 3 stub routes - a home page, a 404 page, and a get places page
- [x] manually adding a gitignore page and readme file

Some of the remaining parts will include:

- [] adding some style with CSS
- [] forms, validation, and navigation
- [] implementing delete functionality and adding a DELETE route
- [] implementing edit for and functionality, adding a PUT route
